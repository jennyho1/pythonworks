PythonWorks
==================
## What this project does
This project introduces python to beginner programmers. It contains lessons of basic python knowledge.

## Why this project is useful
With a simple user interface, it allows beginner programmers to easily learn how to code something small in python without being overwhelmed.

## How we built this 
We built this using the Qoom platform

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
On this webpage, there is a freestyle page where the user can experiment with python console. This is a great way to get them to try out different stuff on their own without having to download python on their own machine.

## What is next for this project
We would like to add an achievement system, which awards users with awards the more lessons they complete. This will motivate them to continue and finish their lessons.
